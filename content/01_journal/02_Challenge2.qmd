To implement the regression challenge, I selected a simple linear regression model.
I actually struggled quite a bit with the way recipes work, but think I figured it out correctly eventually.
I hope that I did use recipes correctly / enough, as I wasn't able to figure out e.g. how to replace NA numbers with zeros (as done in the tutorial; but maybe this wasn't even necessary because the NA numbers were only introduced by the manual dummy creation? Again, I'm not sure about this part.)

Then, as outlined, I then used the predefined evaluation function using yardstick.

The results can be found in `challenge2.R`.
