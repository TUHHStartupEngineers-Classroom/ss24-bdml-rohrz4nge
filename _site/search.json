For the 5th challenge, I used a different model than the previously selected best one, as I couldn’t figure out how to specify the algorithm type of the best performing StackedEnsemble_AllModels_2_AutoML model for the grid search.

Why? Because we cannot compare values (stock prices) that are of completely different magnitudes. In order to standardize, we will convert from adjusted stock price (dollar value) to daily returns (percent change from previous day). Here is the formula.\n\\[\nreturn_{daily} = \\frac{price_{i}-price_{i-1}}{price_{i-1}}\n\\]\nFirst, what do we have?
